"""Compatibility helpers for GOL.GG match payload schemas.

The historical project scripts were written against an older flattened
``golgg_matches.json`` schema using keys such as ``name_1``, ``tid_1`` and
``players_1``. The current dataset uses keys such as ``sname_t1``, ``t1_id``
and stores rosters inside per-game payloads. This module centralizes schema
access so pipeline scripts can remain stable across both formats.
