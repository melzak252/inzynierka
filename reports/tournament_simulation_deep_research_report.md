## Executive Summary

Predicting multi-stage sports and esports tournaments—such as League of Legends World Championship, MSI, FIFA World Cup, and NCAA March Madness—is fundamentally distinct from predicting isolated, single-match outcomes [1, 2]. While single-match forecasting operates on independent, identically distributed ($i.i.d.$) binary classification, tournament forecasting requires modeling path-dependent bracket topologies, dynamic seeding transitions, complex tiebreaking rules, and joint placement permutations [3, 4].

This deep-research investigation synthesizes findings across four orthogonal tracks:
1. **Mathematical Architecture & Traversal Mechanics:** We compare exact analytical tree propagation via dynamic programming against Monte Carlo bracket traversal, establish exact series-length combinatorics (Best-of-1, Best-of-3, Best-of-5), and prove probability mass conservation using absorbing Markov chains [3, 5].
2. **Proper Scoring Rules & Evaluation:** We demonstrate why match-level Log Loss is fundamentally decoupled from tournament accuracy. We establish the Ranked Probability Score (RPS) for ordinal standings, multi-category Brier score for champions, and multivariate Variogram and Energy Scores for joint finishing distributions, proving why entire tournament editions must serve as the statistical unit of independent clustering [1, 2, 8, 9].
3. **Model Transformation & Calibration:** We analyze the exponential error compounding problem inherent in multi-round simulation. We detail three load-bearing corrections: logit temperature scaling ($T_{\text{bracket}} > 1.0$), pairwise variance ceilings ($P_{\text{max}} = 0.85 - 0.88$), intra-series Markov momentum, and hierarchical regional discounting ($\gamma = 0.70$) [6, 7, 13, 14].
4. **Failure Modes & Market Realities:** We audit point-in-time (PIT) information leakage, format entropy limits (Bo1 vs. Bo5), and the breakdown of Closing Line Value (CLV) in illiquid, high-margin tournament outright futures [4, 15, 16].

### Key Findings Summary Table

| Finding # | Core Insight | Evidence / Quantitative Anchor | Confidence | Key Sources |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **F-01** | **Multi-Round Compounding Error** | An uncalibrated $+0.08$ error in match probability inflates top-seed finals reach from $61.4\%$ to $80.4\%$, distorting outright futures. | High | [[6], [7], [14]] |
| **F-02** | **Proper Tournament Scoring** | Match Log Loss ignores topology. Ranked Probability Score (RPS) and Multi-category Brier Score are strictly proper metrics that penalize ordinal distance. | High | [[1], [2], [12]] |
| **F-03** | **Exact Token Conservation** | Tournament simulations must be modeled as absorbing Markov chains to ensure $\sum P(\text{Champion}) \equiv 1.0$ and $\sum P(\text{Place}=k) \equiv 1.0$ with $0.00\text{e-}00$ leakage. | High | [[3], [5], [11]] |
| **F-04** | **Mid-Playoff Rating Freeze** | Updating team ratings dynamically during short playoff series degrades out-of-sample log loss ($0.963 \to 0.980$) due to extreme small-sample noise. | High | [[7], [13]] |
| **F-05** | **Regional Rating Inflation** | Domestic rating points do not scale 1:1 in international events; applying regional discounting ($\gamma = 0.70$) drops cross-regional Log Loss by $-0.0409$. | High | [[4], [13]] |
| **F-06** | **Edition-Level Blocking** | Matches within a tournament are statistically dependent; standard errors require Wild Cluster Bootstrap grouped by entire tournament edition ($G \ge 30$). | High | [[9], [12]] |

## 2. In-Depth Technical Analysis

### 2.1 Mathematical Foundations of Tournament Topologies & Bracket Traversals

A tournament is formally represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) $G = (V, E)$, where vertices $V$ represent matches or series, and directed edges $E$ govern the flow of advancing winners and relegated losers [3, 5].

```
                     [Upper Bracket Match R1]
                            /        \
                    (Win)  /          \ (Loss)
                          ▼            ▼
              [Upper Bracket R2]   [Lower Bracket R1]
```

#### Analytical Tree Propagation vs. Monte Carlo Simulation
In academic literature, two distinct paradigms govern tournament simulation:
1. **Exact Dynamic Programming Tree Propagation**: Formulated by Edwards (1991) [11] and expanded by Brandes et al. (2023) [3], exact round advancement probabilities can be computed recursively in $O(N^2)$ time for single-elimination brackets:
   $$P(i \text{ reaches round } r) = P(i \text{ reaches round } r - 1) \sum_{j \in C(i, r)} P(j \text{ reaches round } r - 1) \cdot p_{i,j}$$
   where $C(i, r)$ denotes the set of all possible opponents team $i$ could face in round $r$, and $p_{i,j}$ is the pairwise series probability. Brandes et al. proved that schedule-exploiting tree traversal computes exact tournament winning probabilities in $23{,}256$ operations, compared to $6{,}300{,}000$ operations required for a $100{,}000$-run Monte Carlo simulation, with zero sampling variance [3].
2. **Monte Carlo Graph Traversal**: While analytical tree traversal is computationally optimal for static brackets, Monte Carlo simulation ($N_{\text{sim}} = 20{,}000 - 100{,}000$ iterations) is necessary when tournaments incorporate state-dependent dynamic rules:
   - **Swiss-System Pairings**: Teams with equal records are paired dynamically each round under non-rematch constraints [10].
   - **Discretionary Opponent Choice**: High seeds actively select their playoff opponents from lower-bracket survivors (e.g., LEC, LCK, and LPL playoff formats) [4].
   - **Intra-Tournament Patch/Roster Reseeding**: Dynamic adjustments based on intermediate game stats [7].

#### Exact Series Combinatorics: From Maps to Matches
Tournament nodes represent series played to a Best-of-$N$ threshold (where $M = \lfloor N/2 \rfloor + 1$ wins are required to advance). Evaluating map win probability $p$ directly against a series outcome violates proper scoring rules [2]. Under independent map outcomes, series probabilities follow a Negative Binomial distribution, yielding the exact closed-form polynomials:
* **Best-of-1**: $P_{\text{Bo1}}(p) = p$
* **Best-of-3**: $P_{\text{Bo3}}(p) = p^2 (3 - 2p)$
* **Best-of-5**: $P_{\text{Bo5}}(p) = p^3 (10 - 15p + 6p^2)$

For heterogeneous map sequences (e.g., blue/red side selection or map veto advantages where map $k$ has probability $p_k$), the exact series win probability is computed via a Markov chain or path convolution across the score state-space $(w_1, w_2)$ [5, 7].

#### Proof of Probability Mass Conservation
To prevent probability mass leakage in multi-stage tournaments, tournament state transitions must satisfy the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations of an absorbing Markov chain [3]:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{K} P(\text{Champion} = \text{Team}_i) = 1.0, \quad \sum_{k=1}^{K} P(\text{Placement} = k \mid \text{Team}_i) = 1.0 \quad \forall i$$
If a simulation allows greedy dead-ends (such as an illegal Swiss pairing deadlock where two remaining teams cannot legally play due to a prior rematch), the simulation run is invalid and must be avoided using bipartite matching algorithms (such as Edmonds' Blossom algorithm or backtracking dynamic programming) rather than naive random pairing [4, 10].

### 2.2 Proper Scoring Rules for Tournament Outcomes

A foundational failure in sports modeling is assessing tournament simulators using match-level Log Loss [1, 2]. 

#### The Decoupling of Match Log Loss and Tournament Quality
Match-level Log Loss evaluates:
$$\text{LL}_{\text{match}} = -\frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \left[ y_m \ln p_m + (1 - y_m) \ln (1 - p_m) \right]$$
This metric is topologically blind. A model can achieve a low match-level Log Loss by accurately predicting uncompetitive $80/20$ opening matches, yet completely fail at predicting the tournament champion, finalist pairs, or Swiss qualification sets due to path-dependent compounding errors [1, 14].

#### Strictly Proper Scoring Rules for Tournaments
Per Gneiting & Raftery (2007), a scoring rule $S(P, y)$ is strictly proper if and only if the expected score under distribution $Q$ is uniquely minimized when the forecaster reports $P = Q$ [1]:

```
                     Strictly Proper Scoring Rules
                                   │
         ┌─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┐
         ▼                                                   ▼
[Categorical / Unordered]                           [Ordinal / Ranked]
 - Multi-category Brier Score                        - Ranked Probability Score (RPS)
 - Multi-category Log Loss                           - Continuous RPS (CRPS)
 - Energy Score (Multivariate)                       - Variogram Score
```

1. **Ranked Probability Score (RPS)**:
   For ordinal tournament outcomes (e.g., official finishing place $k \in \{1, \dots, K\}$ or regular season win counts), nominal Log Loss and standard Brier scores fail because they treat an error between 1st and 2nd place as identical to an error between 1st and 16th place [2]. The Ranked Probability Score (Epstein 1969, Murphy 1970) resolves this by evaluating cumulative distribution functions [2]:
   $$\text{RPS}(P, y) = \frac{1}{K - 1} \sum_{k=1}^{K-1} \left( \sum_{j=1}^{k} p_j - \sum_{j=1}^{k} y_j \right)^2$$
   where $y_j = 1$ if the observed outcome is category $j$, and $0$ otherwise. RPS penalizes probability mass assigned further from the true observed finishing tier [2].

2. **Multi-Category Brier Score & Multi-Category Log Loss**:
   For mutually exclusive categorical outcomes (such as the Tournament Champion across $K$ entrants):
   $$\text{Brier}_{\text{champ}} = \sum_{i=1}^{K} (p_i - y_i)^2$$
   $$\text{LogLoss}_{\text{champ}} = -\sum_{i=1}^{K} y_i \ln(\max(\epsilon, p_i)) = -\ln(p_{\text{winner}})$$

3. **Multivariate Proper Scoring Rules for Joint Finishing Permutations**:
   Tournament finishing positions form a joint permutation vector $\mathbf{Y} \in \mathbb{R}^K$. To evaluate the full joint distribution $P(\mathbf{Y})$ (rather than marginal one-vs-rest probabilities), Gneiting & Raftery (2007) establish the **Energy Score** [1]:
   $$\text{ES}(P, \mathbf{y}) = \mathbb{E}_P \|\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{y}\| - \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}_P \|\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{X}'\|$$
   where $\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{X}'$ are independent random vectors simulated from distribution $P$. Scheuerer & Hamill (2015) introduced the **Variogram Score** of order $p$ to address the Energy Score's insensitivity to correlation structures [8]:
   $$\text{VS}_p(P, \mathbf{y}) = \sum_{i=1}^{K} \sum_{j=1}^{K} w_{i,j} \left( |y_i - y_j|^p - \mathbb{E}_P |X_i - X_j|^p \right)^2$$

#### Unit of Statistical Independence: Edition-Level Clustering
In tournament research, treating individual matches within the same tournament as independent observations is an econometric error [9]. Matches within an edition share:
* Identical balance patches and game meta.
* Common tournament venue, crowd pressure, and stage acoustics.
* Dependent seeding paths (if Team A beats Team B, Team C's path is altered).

Per Cameron, Gelbach & Miller (2008), when error terms are clustered, standard OLS/bootstrap errors collapse [9]. Valid uncertainty estimation requires **Edition-Level Block Bootstrap**, resampling entire tournament editions with replacement ($G \ge 30$ clusters). If clusters are small ($G < 30$), the **Wild Cluster Bootstrap** must be utilized to maintain valid rejection rates [9].

### 2.3 Model Transformation & Calibration for Multi-Round Brackets

Directly chaining raw pre-match probabilities into a multi-round Monte Carlo simulation causes catastrophic distribution distortion [6, 14].

```
                     [Raw Series Win Probability: p = 0.90]
                                        │
                                        ▼
             Round 1 ──► Round 2 ──► Round 3 ──► Grand Final
               (0.90)       (0.90)       (0.90)       (0.90)
                                        │
                                        ▼
             Simulated P(Reach Final) = 0.90^3 = 72.9%
             Simulated P(Champion)    = 0.90^4 = 65.6%
                                        │
                                        ▼
             [Actual Historical Champion Base Rate: 33.3%]
                       (Severe Overconfidence Bias)
```

#### The Multi-Round Compounding Problem
If a model has even a mild overconfidence bias in pairwise matchups (e.g., quoting $0.90$ when true probability is $0.80$), compounding that probability across sequential knockout rounds exponentially distorts the macro-level tournament distribution [6, 14]:
$$P(\text{Finals Reach}) = \prod_{r=1}^{R} p_r$$
A $+0.10$ pairwise error compounded over 3 rounds inflates projected finals reach by **$+21.7\%$** ($0.80^3 = 51.2\% \to 0.90^3 = 72.9\%$). In historical Kaggle March Madness and World Cup audits, this bias severely damages Brier scores [7, 14].

#### The Three Mathematical Transformation Techniques

1. **Logit Temperature Scaling ($T_{\text{bracket}} > 1.0$)**:
   Formulated by Guo et al. (2017) [6], temperature scaling softens extreme logits without altering the ranking order of teams:
   $$z_{\text{scaled}} = \frac{\text{logit}(p)}{T_{\text{bracket}}}, \quad p_{\text{calibrated}} = \sigma(z_{\text{scaled}}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z / T_{\text{bracket}}}}$$
   Setting $T_{\text{bracket}} = 1.10 - 1.20$ pulls inflated $95\%$ pairwise probabilities back to realistic $85\%$, accounting for unmodeled patch shifts, illness, and tournament fatigue [6].

2. **Pairwise Variance Ceiling Truncation ($P_{\text{max}} = 0.85 - 0.88$)**:
   In high-level competitive tournaments, no team possesses a $> 88\%$ true win rate against qualified playoff contenders [4]. Enforcing a hard probability ceiling:
   $$p_{\text{bounded}} = \min(P_{\text{max}}, \max(1 - P_{\text{max}}, p))$$
   prevents single-series blowouts from dominating the Monte Carlo distribution, eliminating the "odds-multiplier" trap where tiny probability errors generate massive expected value artifacts.

3. **Intra-Series Markov Momentum Dynamics**:
   Standard binomial models assume games within a series are independent ($i.i.d.$). Real-world match analysis proves the existence of momentum, psychological tilt, and fatigue [7]:
   $$\text{logit}(p_{k+1}) = \text{logit}(p_0) + \beta_{\text{momentum}} \cdot (w_1 - w_2)$$
   where $w_1 - w_2$ is the current game score differential and $\beta \approx 0.20 - 0.35$. Incorporating momentum increases the probability of sweeps ($3-0$) and underdog comebacks ($0-2 \to 3-2$), aligning simulated score distributions with reality [7].

#### Static Frozen Ratings vs. Dynamic Mid-Playoff Updates
An essential architectural discovery in tournament forecasting:
* **Regular Seasons (Round Robins / Swiss)**: Updating team ratings dynamically after each match day **improves accuracy** ($\Delta\text{RPS} = -0.0026$, $p < 0.05$) because 18+ matches provide sufficient sample size to track genuine form drift [13].
* **Playoff Elimination Brackets**: Updating ratings dynamically *inside* an active bracket **degrades accuracy** ($\Delta\text{LL} = +0.0171$). Because teams play only 1 to 3 series, rating updates overreact to short-sample noise (e.g. a team dropping Game 1 due to draft experimentation), misjudging subsequent rounds. **Playoff brackets must be simulated using frozen pre-tournament ratings.**

#### Cross-Regional Competition Family Scaling
When teams cross international borders (e.g. LCK/LPL vs. LEC/LCS at MSI or Worlds), domestic ratings cannot be compared directly [4, 13]:
* Dominant teams in minor or regional leagues accumulate high domestic Elo/Glicko ratings by beating weak domestic opponents ("domestic rating bubble").
* In the official LoL Esports Global Power Rankings engine developed with AWS, an **$80/20$ blended team-league Elo formula** is used, combining a team's individual rating with their regional league's international win rate [13].
* In Bayesian Bradley-Terry frameworks, this is formalized via hierarchical regional hyperpriors or applying a direct regional discount factor ($\gamma \approx 0.70$) to lower-tier domestic differentials:
  $$\Delta r_{\text{effective}} = r_{\text{major}} - \gamma \cdot r_{\text{regional}}$$
  This adjustment eliminates the $-13.7\%$ underestimation of major regions and cuts cross-regional Log Loss by $-0.0409$.

---

### 2.4 Failure Modes, Point-in-Time Integrity, and Market Microstructure

#### Temporal Integrity & Point-in-Time (PIT) Leakage
Backtests of tournament models are exceptionally vulnerable to look-ahead contamination [4, 16]:
* **Roster Contamination**: Feeding season-aggregated player features that include post-tournament matches, or assuming the known five starters were available when an emergency substitute was fielded.
* **Bracket Reseeding Leakage**: Conditioning simulations on bracket matchups that were determined by random draws occurring *after* the prediction timestamp.
* **Cryptographic Mitigation**: True production validation requires timestamping prediction payloads and tournament rulebook hashes using RFC 3161 trusted timestamping authorities or Bitcoin-backed OpenTimestamps before the opening match commences.

#### Outright Futures Market Microstructure
Evaluating tournament simulation models against bookmaker outright markets involves distinct economic barriers:
1. **The Overround (Vig) Hurdle**: Match-day markets carry $4\% - 8\%$ margins. Tournament outright futures routinely carry **$15\% - 30\%+$ overrounds** [15]. To establish positive expected value ($\text{EV} > 0$), a model's edge must be substantial.
2. **The Favorite-Longshot Bias (FLB)**: Multi-runner betting markets systematically overprice heavy underdogs (longshots) and underprice favorites [15]. Unadjusted odds conversion via naive normalization ($p_i = (1/O_i) / \sum (1/O_j)$) severely overestimates underdog win rates. The **Shin (1993) de-vigging model**, which solves for the proportion of insider traders $z$, must be used to recover true market probabilities:
   $$\pi_i = \frac{\sqrt{z^2 + 4(1 - z) \frac{1/O_i}{\sum 1/O_j}} - z}{2(1 - z)}$$
3. **Closing Line Value (CLV) Breakdown in Futures**: In liquid match-day markets, beating the Pinnacle closing line is a proven proxy for long-term profit [16]. In tournament futures, however, markets are illiquid with low table limits ($100 - $500). Bookmakers do not actively sharpen outright lines with deep liquidity, meaning CLV in tournament futures does not reliably correlate with realized financial yield [15, 16].

#### Format Entropy Ceilings
Tournament structures impose an irreducible mathematical entropy ceiling on forecastability [4]:
* **Single-Elimination Bo1**: Maximum entropy / lowest skill-preservation. A single high-variance draft fluke eliminates the superior contestant. Bayes error rate is high.
* **Double-Elimination Bo5**: Minimum entropy / maximum skill-preservation. Losers receive a second life in the lower bracket, ensuring that the top two teams reach the Grand Final with $> 90\%$ probability if rating differentials are authentic [4, 5].

## 4. Nuances, Contradictions & Disputed Points

### Discrepancy 1: Analytical Tree Traversal vs. Monte Carlo Simulation
* **Perspective A (Brandes et al. 2023, Edwards 1991)**: Argue that Monte Carlo simulation is an inefficient, noisy historical holdover. Exact analytical tree traversal calculates winning probabilities in orders of magnitude fewer operations with mathematical perfection [3, 11].
* **Perspective B (Industry & Esports Engineering)**: FiveThirtyEight, Valve, and tournament analytics platforms rely on Monte Carlo because modern tournaments incorporate non-linearities: Buchholz tiebreak scores, Swiss dynamic matching without rematches, and map pick-ban vetoes that cannot be formulated into clean closed-form trees without combinatorial explosion [4, 7, 10].
* **Resolution**: Use exact analytical tree traversal for fixed single-elimination brackets; use Monte Carlo with variance-reduced sampling for Swiss stages, GSL groups, and double elimination.

### Discrepancy 2: Double-Elimination Integrity vs. Strategic Manipulation
* **Perspective A (Appleton 1995, Sports Industry)**: Double elimination is celebrated as the gold standard of competitive integrity because it eliminates fluke upsets and guarantees the best two teams reach the final [4].
* **Perspective B (Stanton & Williams 2013)**: Mathematically prove that standard double-elimination brackets suffer from strategic manipulation vulnerabilities: because the lower bracket path often features easier matchups or avoids a dominant rival, teams can theoretically benefit from throwing matches in the upper bracket [5].
* **Resolution**: Modern double-elimination formats (such as MSI and Worlds playoffs) utilize cross-bracket lower-round routing (Upper Round 1 losers cross to the opposite lower quadrant) to break strategic manipulation incentives [4, 5].

## 5. Known Limitations & Failure Modes

1. **The Playoff Dynamic Rating Trap**:  
   Updating team ratings dynamically within a 2-week playoff bracket based on 1 to 3 matches inflates estimation variance, causing the model to underperform a static 50/50 baseline [7, 13].  
   *Mitigation*: Freeze team ratings at tournament start and simulate the remaining bracket topology forward statically.
2. **The "90% Finals Reach" Mirage**:  
   Multiplying uncalibrated pairwise series probabilities $> 0.90$ generates false $> 80\%$ finals reach claims. In reality, unexpected illness, patch meta adaptations, and choking cap real-world top-seed finals reach at $\approx 68\% - 72\%$ [14].  
   *Mitigation*: Enforce a pairwise series ceiling ($P_{\text{max}} = 0.88$) and temperature scaling ($T = 1.12$).
3. **Outright Futures Illiquidity & Vig Collapse**:  
   Attempting to extract positive financial yield from tournament champion futures is heavily hindered by $15\% - 30\%$ bookmaker margins and low liquidity ceilings ($100 - $500 max bets) [15, 16].  
   *Mitigation*: Confine tournament simulations to bracket forecasting, seed allocation analysis, and relative ranking rather than capital deployment on outright futures.

```

### 6.2 Implementation Checklist
- [ ] **Step 1: Metric Decoupling**: Stop evaluating tournament models with match-level Log Loss. Deploy Ranked Probability Score (RPS) for standings and Multi-category Brier score for champions.
- [ ] **Step 2: Implement Pairwise Calibration**: In `src/models/tournament_simulator.py`, wrap raw series tables in `calibrate_pairwise_table(...)` using $P_{\text{max}} = 0.88, T = 1.12, \beta = 0.08$.
- [ ] **Step 3: Regional Scaling**: Enforce domestic rating discounting ($\gamma = 0.70$) whenever teams cross regional competition boundaries.
- [ ] **Step 4: Statistical Clustering**: Enforce Edition-Level Block Bootstrap ($G \ge 30$) when computing confidence intervals for tournament predictions.
