"""Rebuild operational Elo/Glicko/TrueSkill/OpenSkill ratings from GOL.GG SQLite.

This mirrors the historical rating flow from
`scripts/05_ratingi_baseline/03_generate_ratings.py`:

- matches are processed chronologically,
- ratings are updated only after each finished game/match,
- Glicko RD time decay is applied before each match,
- Elo/TrueSkill/OpenSkill/Plackett-Luce/Thurstone-Mosteller update per game,
- Glicko updates per game after the match via `RatingManager.update_after_match`.

The output is written to `rating_runs` and `entity_ratings` for upcoming-match
inference.
