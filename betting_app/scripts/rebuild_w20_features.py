"""Rebuild leakage-safe W20 team rolling context from GOL.GG SQLite.

This mirrors the rolling-context logic used by the final metamodel experiments:
for each team we maintain a deque of the last N completed games and average:

- win_rate,
- kills/deaths,
- GD@15,
- DPM/VSPM,
- towers/nashors/gold/duration,
- dragons as an extra operational field.

The script stores the *latest* rolling state per team in `team_rolling_features`.
That is the context snapshot needed for upcoming-match inference after the local
GOL.GG cache has been refreshed and imported.
