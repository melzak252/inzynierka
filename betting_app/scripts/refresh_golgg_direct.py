"""Incrementally refresh finished GOL.GG matches directly into TimescaleDB.

Unlike refresh_golgg_results.py, this script skips the JSON cache entirely:
- Existing match IDs are read from the golgg_matches table
- Newly fetched match game data is written directly to the DB via import_golgg_batch()
- After import, newly added matches are auto-mapped to canonical_matches
  by date + team name proximity
- No golgg_matches.json file is read or written

Intended to be run periodically (every 6-12 hours) via the scheduler.
